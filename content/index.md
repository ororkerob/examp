# gohugo-amp
This Hugo theme is supposed to be a starter theme to make it easy to adapt to [Google's AMP-Project](https://www.ampproject.org/). Included in the theme are [**40+ shortcodes and partials**](https://gohugo-amp.gohugohq.com/shortcodes/) and [automatic Structured Data](https://gohugo-amp.gohugohq.com/schema/) making it a pleasure to embed AMP-Elements within your content files or your template.
